                <p>Squish is an easy, fun to use toy. What makes it so innovative and accessible is that it opens up vibrator use to more people. Some buttoned vibrators aren’t incredibly user-friendly, especially for folks with disabilities. To activate the vibration in the Squish, all you have to do is give it a squeeze. Like the packaging says: “Squeeze me to death! Like, not actually. But close.”</p>
